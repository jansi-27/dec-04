            <h3>Frozen Banana Cereal Pops</h3>
            <p>When we want a healthy snack, we dip bananas in yogurt, roll 'em in cereal, then freeze. Ta-da! —Scarlett

            <h3>Oklahoma Coconut Poke Cake</h3>
            <p>Coconut is the star of this cake. You get a double dose, once in the mixture that soaks into the coconut
                poke cake and second with it sprinkled on top. Don’t worry though, it’s a nice flavor treat…it’s not too
                much coconut. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen, Greendale, Wisconsin</p>

            <h3>Pecan Caramel Candies</h3>
            <p>Salty and sweet, these candies are the perfect little snack. Form a kitchen assembly line with your kids,
                and the making becomes just as fun as the eating. —Julie Wemhoff, Angola, Indiana</p>

            <h3>Strawberry-Rosemary Yogurt Pops</h3>
            <p>We planted strawberries a few years ago and these tangy-sweet frozen yogurt pops are my very favorite
                treats to make with them! The options are endless. Try using other yogurt flavors like lemon, raspberry
                or blueberry. —Carmell Childs, Orangeville, Utah

            <h3>Mini Blueberry Tarts</h3>
            <p>I served this recipe to my family while we were on vacation and they were all amazed! The best part: I
                didn't spend tons of time on it thanks to refrigerated pie crust. Watch your mini tarts around the
                13-minute mark to make sure they don't brown too quickly. If you'd like, sprinkle the tops with coarse
                sugar for a beautiful finishing touch.—Allison Bell, Hillsdale, New Jersey</p>
